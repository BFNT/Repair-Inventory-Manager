# ISEN Repair Inventory Manager


## Brief description
The ISEN Repair Inventory Manager
 is a project for the ultimate goal tracking and managing computers 
restored by the ISEN Repair Club. The specifications are constantly changing according to the needs 
and the remarks making it even easier to use.

## How to install ?
You have two options for that :
- Using the ClickOnce's Microsoft technology for automated install and update 
(Certified without ads/virus/unwanted content). Because I hate it ^^
- Using the zip package in releases section to manually install of the app. In this way the application 
can be installed on a key including the database (Be careful not to lose it, make backups !!)
In the case of updating the two ways seen above, they are carried out without erasing the database. 
(But we will never repeat it enough: make backups !!!)

## How to use this sh***t ?
Sorry... I'm busy on it :/

## What is planned ?
- Until the end of the 0.9 alpha the software will have to do the minimum of what is asked, ie it will 
at least be able to record and manage the tracking of each computer individually.
- Starting with the 0.9 beta, the software will begin to have improvements after the return of users 
to improve its ergonomics and use.
- Version 1.0 will be released when all aspects of improvements have been properly completed. As the 
minor versions (1.1, 1.2, 1.3,...), there will be additions of functions for the more parts mentioned 
in the project V1.0 section.
- (Uncertain) For version 2.0, the system will be completely revised to run on a SQL database and also 
have 'online' support to use its smartphone for all tracking operations.
- (Even more uncertain) For future versions, there will still be additions of functions that will be 
for the most parts cited in the project V2.0 section, with the possibility of adding a web platform allowing 
customers / schools to make a return On the hardware, inform us in case of breakdown, etc...
